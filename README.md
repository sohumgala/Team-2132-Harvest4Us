# Harvest4Us 
* Harvest4Us is an android application that connects local farmers to their community, making it easy for consumers to buy fresh produce.

# Installation Guide

To run the Harvest4Us app, you will first need to set up the backend. Once the backend is up and running, you can then build and run the app via Android Studio.

## Backend Setup
The backend is comprised of a Flask HTTP server connected to a MYSQL database. This section will show how to setup the backend and database locally.

### Local Database setup (Only needs to be done once)

You will need to install MySQL server and MySQL client. Both can be downloaded from MySQL's [website](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/). A MySQL IDE such as Workbench will also be useful for running the scripts. Workbench can also be downloaded from MySQL's website.

Once you have MySQL installed, you will need to:
* Run the ```schema``` SQL script and then the ```dummy_data``` SQL script. Both can be found in the sql-table-setup folder. This can be done using MySQL Workbench.
* In the backend folder, create a file named ```db_auth.json```. In the file, paste in the following:

``` json
{ 

    "user": "your_username", 

    "password": "your_password", 

    "host": "127.0.0.1", 

    "port": 3306, 

    "database": "harvest4us" 
} 
```
* Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your username(most likely it is `root`) and password you created during MySQL installation.

The database will now be setup and ready to be used by the Flask backend.

## Flask Backend Installation (Only needs to be done once)
The backend is built with Flask, a backend Python framework. You will first need to ensure Python is [installed on your system](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (it is installed by default on most Mac/Linux machines, but not Windows). 

The backend requires a few Python dependencies. All of these dependencies can be installed via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). Run the following commands to install the dependencies: 

* `pip install flask`
* `pip install mysql-connector-python`
* `pip install requests` 

## Running the Backend

Once the database is setup and all of the dependencies are installed, you can now run the backend. Navigate to the backend folder in your terminal and run the following commands:
* export FLASK_APP=main
* flask run

The backend will now be running in the terminal. Leave the terminal open to keep the backend running.

## Run the Android app
The app can be built and run using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/). The app's source code is contained in the Harvest4usMOBILE folder. Open that folder as a project in Android Studio, and then the app can be built and run on either an Android emulator or an Android phone connected via USB. No additional configuration is needed to run the app on an emulator.

### Running on Android Phone
To run on an Android phone, you will need to change the following line in `FlaskBackendConnect.kt` from
``` Kotlin
    private val urlPrefix = emulatorUrl
```
to 
``` Kotlin
    private val urlPrefix = adbUrl
```
And, with the phone connected, run the command `adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000` in your terminal.

### Running with Cardknox SDK Enabled
The `master` branch currently does not include the payment processing SDK, provided by Cardknox. This is because the Cardknox SDK has a dependency not included in the ABI used by x86 Android emulators. The Cardknox SDK can be used on ARM Android emulators or on actual Android devices.

The `cardknox_dev` branch includes the Cardknox SDK and implementation within the app. To use it, you will need a valid Cardknox API key. Add the API key to the bottom of the `local.properties` file in the Harvest4UsMOBILE folder like this:
```
cardknox_api_key=key
```
Where `key` is the API key provided by Cardknox. Clean and rebuild the project in Android Studio and the Cardknox UI will be enabled. Note that the `local.properties` file should not ever be checked into version control.

# Release Notes
